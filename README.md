# Walking-Within-Game

To make it easier, I published the game on Unity Play. You can play the game via the following link: https://play.unity.com/en/games/094660fe-8a83-489f-a692-12d32323afce/walking-within

In this repository, there includes all of the files I used to create the game. To access the codes I used to program the game, go to Assets > Scripts and 
there will lie all of the scripts used to program each of the functions of the game!

Have fun!
